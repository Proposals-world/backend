Hosted Checkout

The Hosted Checkout integration method is ideal when you want a solution that is both secure and fast to deploy. In this integration, you create a checkout session where the Mastercard Gateway hosts a payment page UI that gathers payment information from the customer, so you need not handle sensitive data at all.
For initial transactions that require payer participation (to provide their payment details), you use the checkout session to display a Hosted Payment Page for the payer. For merchant-initiated and subsequent transactions that do not require payer participation, you simply send an API request from your server.
Hosted Checkout does have some limitations, mainly that you cannot customize the payment flow and payment page UI beyond adding your merchant-specific name and logo.

Key benefits
Hosted Checkout has the following key benefits:
Integration process is simple and quick.
You do not need to handle or store any payment details, which may lower PCI compliance costs.
You can use the theme offered by your payment service provider to display your Hosted Checkout interface. This allows you to leverage the brand of your PSP. A strong brand reduces a payer's reticence to provide payment details.
You can customize the content of the Hosted Checkout interface to display your business information.
If you have subscribed to notifications, you can choose to be notified when the payment is successful.
Hosted Checkout is WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.0 Level AA compliant.
Information flow
The information flow for creating a transaction with Hosted Checkout using the Hosted Payment Page is illustrated below:
Integration Steps

To implement the basic Hosted Checkout solution in your system, follow the instructions below.
Prerequisites
Before implementing a Hosted Checkout solution, check with your payment service provider to ensure you meet the following prerequisites:
Ensure that you have a merchant account and that your merchant profile is enabled for the Hosted Checkout service.
Select and set up your API authentication method.
If you want to be notified of successful payments, enable the Notifications service. It allows the Mastercard Gateway to send email or Webhook notifications to you, and email notifications to the payer on your behalf.
Implementing a Hosted Checkout solution
The Hosted Checkout solution works through API operations (requests and responses), which are used to, for example, initiate or retrieve information about various payment transactions and store card details. You also need the Checkout JavaScript library to implement the Hosted Payment Page in your app or web page, when payer participation is needed to gather payment details for a transaction.
You can use all the API operations available for the REST Server APIs. However, you have no need for the Hosted Session-related API operations, as they are only needed for the related integration method. For general information about making server API requests, see Making a Server API Request.
To perform an operation, you must first have it enabled on your merchant profile by your payment service provider. To check which operations are available for you to use, contact your payment service provider.
The operations available to you are limited to the capability of the acquirers configured on your merchant profile with the gateway. If a functionality is not supported for the acquirer on the gateway, any operation requests to execute that functionality are rejected by the gateway (for that acquirer).
When payer participation is needed, each task you perform with Hosted Checkout consists of the following steps:
Establish a checkout session
Request a checkout session using the INITIATE CHECKOUT operation.
Implement the Hosted Payment Page
Show the payer either an Embedded Page or a Payment Page and start the payment process. Optionally, include callbacks for handling events that occur during the payment interaction, such as the payer cancelling the payment, the session timing out, or redirecting the payer to another website to finish payment (such as when using PayPal).
Interpret the response
Receive the results of the payment from the gateway and update your system with the payment details. Return the payer to your web site and display the payment receipt to them.
For a collection of example requests covering the common transaction operation requests, download the Postman collection.
The API request to establish the checkout session must be made from the merchant's backend server. Do not invoke any API operation directly from the payer's browser.
After your integration is completed and you are able to manage the initial transaction with the payer using the Hosted Payment Page to provide their payment details and authorization:
Determine any customizations you need to make based on the specific payment methods you want to support on the Hosted Payment Page.
Define any customizations you want to use in the Hosted Payment PageCheckout.
Consider what kind of security or other additional features you want to offer or use in your integration.
Implement any subsequent transactions you want to initiate from your backend server, such as CAPTURE or REFUND
Test your entire solution.
Before you complete your integration, see the Frequently asked questions section for answers to some common concerns and tips.
Frequently asked questions
Are Microsoft browsers supported by Hosted Checkout?
Yes, Microsoft Edge versions 113 and newer are supported.
How secure is the Hosted Checkout integration?
The Hosted Checkout model is secure as it requires you to authenticate to the gateway, and the payment details collected on the Hosted Payment Page are submitted directly from the payer's browser to the gateway.
If you choose not to redirect the payer from the Hosted Payment Page back to your web site, check the notification email or log onto Merchant Administration to ensure that the order details are correct before you ship the goods or services to the payer.
How can I optimize my mobile interactions with Hosted Checkout?
If you want to offer your customers a good mobile experience for Hosted Checkout, add a meta tag named viewport to your site's page.

      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  
Define the right viewport values for your pages and test your own site with them.

Frequently asked questions
Establishing a Session

The first step of a Hosted Checkout transaction is to send an API request to the Mastercard Gateway using the INITIATE CHECKOUT operation. The request creates a checkout session in the gateway, and must include:
Details related to the PAY, AUTHORIZE, or VERIFY transaction you want to create.
Information about how the Hosted Payment Page must interact with the payer.
Instructions for completing the Hosted Payment Page process.
For all parameters and request body fields supported for the request, see Initiate Checkout.
For API v62 and earlier, use the CREATE CHECKOUT SESSION operation instead of Initiate Checkout.
For general instructions on making an API request from your backend server, see Making a Server API Request.
The following example shows a cURL code snippet for the INITIATE CHECKOUT request.
INITIATE CHECKOUT Example
URL	curl --location https://test-gateway.mastercard.com/api/rest/version/72/merchant/<merchant_ID>/session'\


--header 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded string of "merchant.<merchant ID>:<password>"' \
--data ' {
    "apiOperation": "INITIATE_CHECKOUT",
    "interaction":{
        "operation" :"AUTHORIZE",
        "merchant": {
           "name": "<merchant_name>"
        }
    },
    "order": {
        "currency":"USD",
        "amount": "100.00",
        "id" : "<order_ID>",
        "description": "<description_of_order>"
    }
 }
'

   
For more information about how to generate the API password, see Setting up API Credentials.
A successful INITIATE CHECKOUT response contains the session.id and successIndicator fields. Check the successIndicator field value to verify the success or failure of the payment. For details, see Obtaining the Payment Result.
Implementing the Hosted Payment Page

You have two options for implementing the Hosted Payment Page:
Embedded Page is a component that is activated within your website's existing checkout page.
Payment Page is a separate page to which the payer is redirected from your existing checkout page.
If you have originally implemented a Lightbox page (with API v62 or earlier), your payment page is a modal dialog displayed on top of your existing checkout page. The newer API versions do not directly support this implementation, but if you are migrating to a newer API version, you can use a Modal mode, which allows you to use the Lightbox as an extension of the Embedded Page.
Once a checkout session has been established, the process of implementing the Hosted Payment Page for Hosted Checkout consists of the following steps:
Create a Checkout object.
Configure the Checkout object.
Use the appropriate method of the Checkout object to start the payment process.

In addition, you can define callbacks that are triggered when the payer takes certain actions during the payment process.
The Hosted Payment Page implementation is done in your app or web site, using the Checkout JavaScript (JS) library.
Step 1: Create the checkout object
After the session has been initialized, you need to refer to the checkout.min.js file from the gateway server on your checkout page. This places a Checkout object into the global scope.
Example

<script src="https://test-gateway.mastercard.com/static/checkout/checkout.min.js" data-error="errorCallback" data-cancel="cancelCallback"></script>

              
If you are enabled for both the AUTHORIZATION and PAY operations, you must use Hosted Checkout v52 or above.
Step 2: Configure the checkout object
Call the Checkout.configure() function and pass it a JSON object that includes the session.id returned from the Initiate Checkout operation earlier.
Example

        Checkout.configure({
                      session: {
                        id: '<your_initiate_checkout_ID>'
                        }
                    });

       
In API v67 or later, the session object is the only field allowed through configure() - all other fields must be included through INITIATE CHECKOUT.
Data passed in Checkout.configure() never overwrites the data you already provided in the INITIATE CHECKOUT operation.
Step 3: Start the payment process
Start the payment process by calling one of the following methods of the Checkout object, depending on what kind of Hosted Payment Page you are implementing.
To display the checkout interaction on an Embedded Page:
Example


Checkout.showEmbeddedPage('#embed-target')
To display the checkout interaction on a Payment Page:
Example


Checkout.showPaymentPage()

                       });



                     $('#exampleModal').on('hide.bs.modal', function (e) {

                      sessionStorage.clear(); // tell Checkout to clear sessionStorage when I close the modal

                      });
        </script>
      </body>
      </html>

Step 4: Implementing callbacks
Callbacks are provided to handle events that can occur during the payment interaction. Using callbacks is optional, but if you need them, you must define them in the body of the same <script> tag that references checkout.min.js.
All defined callbacks must have an implementation. They are invoked when the relevant event is triggered. The following code sample shows an example of a callback (triggered if the payer cancels the payment) being defined and implemented on a page.
Callback Example


<script src="https://test-gateway.mastercard.com/static/checkout/checkout.min.js"
         data-cancel="cancelCallback"
         data-beforeRedirect="Checkout.saveFormFields"
         data-afterRedirect="Checkout.restoreFormFields">
</script>

<script>
     function cancelCallback() {
          confirm('Are you sure you want to cancel?');
         // code to manage payer interaction
    }
// or if you want to provide a URL:
// cancelCallback = "someURL"
</script>
There are two types of callback methods: basic callbacks and redirect callbacks.
Basic callbacks
Basic callbacks are provided for the following events:
cancel: When the payer cancels the payment interaction.
The cancel callback can only be used with a Payment Page, it does not work with an Embedded Page.
error: When an error is encountered.
complete: When the payer completes the payment interaction.
timeout: When the payment is not completed within the duration available to the payer to make the payment.
These callbacks can be defined as functions, as in the example above, or as URLs. If you provide a URL instead of a function in a callback, the payer is redirected to this URL when the event is triggered.
Redirect callbacks
Since Hosted Checkout supports payment interactions that require the payer to be redirected away to other web sites to progress the payment, such as PayPal, callbacks are provided to manage what happens before the redirect and after the return to Hosted Checkout to finalize transaction processing:
beforeRedirect: Before the payer is presented with the payment interface. Returns data required to restore the payment interface state for use by afterRedirect.
afterRedirect: When the payer returns from completing the payment interaction. Uses the data saved by beforeRedirect to return the saved payment interface state.
The Checkout object also provides two functions to help you implement the beforeRedirect and afterRedirect callbacks:
saveFormFields(): Saves all current form fields for use by restoreFormFields(). Use in your beforeRedirect implementation or implement beforeRedirect as Checkout.saveFormFields().
restoreFormFields(): Restores form fields saved by saveFormFields(). Use in your afterRedirect implementation or implement afterRedirect as Checkout.restoreFormFields().
Frequently asked questions
What should I do if Hosted Checkout returns an error?
Hosted Checkout can return a number of integration errors. See Testing Steps for more information about testing and errors.
Why am I getting an error page instead of the Hosted Payment Page?
An error page displays when an incorrect Hosted Checkout request is attempted. Common causes for errors include:
Missing mandatory fields.
URLs provided in the request not being absolute.
What happens if the payer double-clicks the Pay button?
If the payer double-clicks the Pay button, that is, submits the payment twice, then the transaction is not repeated with your or the payer's bank.

Frequently asked questions
Subsequent Operations

When using the Hosted Checkout integration method, the payment process for a new order starts with an initial transaction (PAY, AUTHORIZE, or VERIFY).
The initial transaction defines all the important information for the order:
Details about the order itself (such as ID, amount, and currency)
Payment method to be used for the payment
Payment details of the payer
If you are using a PAY transaction and the payer receives the goods they ordered and is happy with them, the order is complete and no other actions are needed. However, in many scenarios subsequent transactions can be needed to handle the remaining lifecycle of the order.
Subsequent scenarios
The following scenarios are examples of situations where you need to send subsequent transactions for your existing order:
If you use a VERIFY transaction (often created with the order amount set to zero) as the initial transaction to verify the payer's account details, you need to follow up with a PAY or AUTHORIZE transaction to define the correct order amount and initiate the money transfer.
If you use an AUTHORIZE transaction as the initial transaction, you need to follow up with a CAPTURE transaction, when you are ready to ship the goods and want the money to exchange hands.
If there is a delay in your ability to ship the goods, you may also need to use the UPDATE AUTHORIZATION transaction to keep the authorization active until you are ready to capture it.
If the order is cancelled for any reason, you need to use the VOID transaction to immediately cancel it with the gateway as well. If the payment details have already been sent to the bank, you need to use the REFUND transaction, which is also needed if the payer is not happy with their purchase and wants to return it.
The RETRIEVE TRANSACTION and RETRIEVE ORDER API operations can also be considered subsequent transactions, though they are used only to retrieve details of an existing order, and do not impact the order lifecycle. For a list of all available subsequent transactions, see Transactions.
Linking to initial transaction
All the transactions related to the same order must be linked so that the various payment systems (Mastercard Gateway and banks) can identify them as belonging together.
The linking is done by using the same order ID in every transaction related to the order. The order ID is provided as a path parameter in the request URL.
Shared data in subsequent transactions
Linking different transactions together within the same order means that you only need to provide specific data about the order once. The gateway stores the details for the order and can use them, as needed, when processing any subsequent transactions.
In any subsequent transaction, you only need to provide the data specific to that transaction. For example:
In a CAPTURE transaction, you need to provide the amount and currency for the goods you are shipping at that point (which may be the full or partial order amount).
In a REFUND transaction, you need to provide the amount and currency for the refund you are sending (which may be the full or partial order amount).
In a VOID transaction, you need to provide the transaction ID of the exact transaction you want to cancel.
In a REFERRAL transaction, you need to provide the authorization code that allows the issuer to approve the previously failed transaction.
If you provide identical information in multiple transactions within an order, the gateway ignores it. If you update any information in a subsequent transaction, the gateway updates the order details accordingly. For example, you have first provided a shipping address in the initial AUTHORIZE transaction, and the payer moves. You can then add a new shipping address to the CAPTURE transaction.

Subsequent scenarios
Linking to initial transaction
Shared data in subsequent transactions
Interpreting the Response

Once the payer has completed their Hosted Payment Page interaction, you need to redirect them back to your web site, determine the payment result, and present them with a receipt.
Step 1: Redirect the payer to your website
Once the payer finishes their Hosted Payment Page interaction, they are returned to your web site. To accomplish this, you need to provide the URL to which they are redirected to in one of the following ways:
Provide the interaction.returnUrl field in the Initiate Checkout operation.
Define the complete callback for the Hosted Payment Page. For details, see Implementing Callbacks.
Step 2: Determine the payment result
The gateway sends the result of the payment in a resultIndicator field in one of two ways, depending on how the payer was redirected back to your site:
Appended to the URL (interaction.returnUrl) used for returning the payer to your web site.
Provided as an input parameter to the function provided in the complete callback or appended to the URL provided in the complete callback.
You can determine the success of the payment by comparing the resultIndicator parameter to the successIndicator parameter returned in the INITIATE CHECKOUT response. A match indicates that the payment is successful.
Do not use the value in the resultIndicator parameter as the receipt number.
Step 3: Display a payment receipt
If the operation was successful, display a payment receipt to the payer on your web site, and update your system with the payment details. You can retrieve the payment details in various ways:
With an API request - Use the Retrieve Order operation.
From Merchant Administration - The payment details are recorded in the Merchant Administration in the Order and Transaction Details page. You can search for the payment and perform subsequent operations.
Using Reporting - If your merchant profile has the Reporting feature enabled, you can download payment data in a formatted report from the gateway.
From email or Webhook notifications - If you subscribe to notifications in the Merchant Administration, you receive an email or Webhook notification for every successful payment.
Spend some time examining the transaction response fields for each relevant operation in the API Reference. All the fields provide valuable information, you can store some of them locally for accounting, reconciliation, and traceability reasons. The more complex your integration is, the more useful it can be to study specific response codes to identify all aspects of the transaction status.
It is good practice to validate whether the data you supplied for the transaction is the same as the data used to process the transaction. For example, check that the amount returned in the transaction response matches the value you sent in the request.

Customizing the Checkout

If you are using Hosted Checkout integration method, you can use the following ways to customize the Hosted Payment Page that Mastercard Gateway displays to the payer:
Customizing the Payment Experience: You can control how information is displayed on the payment page, including which payer information elements are shown. You can also display your merchant name and logo.
Improving Accessibility: You can ensure that your payment interface conforms to accessibility standards.
Customize Redirect and Retry Behavior: You can redirect your customers to your application or encourage them to retry in the event of successful and failed transactions.
Mobile Wallets: Mobile wallets allow you to store and manage your payment methods digitally, making transactions simpler and faster.
Integrate Apple Pay in Hosted Checkout
Integrate Google Pay in Hosted Checkout
Customizing the Payment Experience

If you are using the Hosted Checkout, you can customize the display of information on the Hosted Payment Page as it relates to your business and the interaction with the payer. The customizations are defined in the INITIATE CHECKOUT operation.
You can customize the payment experience with the following options:
Display brand information: You can display your logo and contact details by using the corresponding fields within the interaction.merchant object.
The fields provided in the interaction.merchant object are displayed on the receipt page for Payment Page integrations only, not for Embedded Page.
Manage the display of a payer billing and an email addresses: After collecting billing and email addresses from your payer, you can display them and control the way they can be edited by setting the interaction.displayControl.billingAddress and interaction.displayControl.customerEmail fields to one of the following values:
HIDE: Do not display the address.
MANDATORY: Display the address element and make data entry compulsory for the payer.
OPTIONAL: Display the address element, but allow the payer to opt out of entering data into it.
READ_ONLY: Display the address, but do not allow the payer to edit it.
Manage the display of shipping details: After collecting shipping details from your payer, you can control their display by setting the interaction.displayControl.shipping field to one of the following values:
HIDE: Do not display the shipping details.
READ_ONLY: Display the shipping details, but do not allow the payer to edit them.
Warning
The payer is not able to edit any of the shippings details previously provided.
The functionality of the same as Shipping check box is not available if the required shipping details have not been supplied.
Manage language and theme: By default, the language displayed on the Hosted Payment Page is determined from the payer's browser. However, you can override this behavior by specifying a language identifier or IETF language tag in the locale field; for example, en_US, es, or fr_CA. If the language you specify is not supported by the gateway, the page is displayed in the best matching language. By default, the theme set by your payment service provider (PSP) controls the look and feel of the Hosted Payment Page. If your PSP supports multiple themes, you can choose to override the default theme by providing the interaction.style.theme field in your request.
Order ID: It is mandatory to include order.id in your request to identify a payment initiated from Hosted Checkout. You can use an identifier generated by your shopping cart or supply your own. However, ensure that it is unique.
For more information about the individual fields, see INITIATE CHECKOUT.

Payment method sequence customization
You can arrange the payment methods in a sequence so that they display on HCO based on the configuration you provide. The capability to organize the sequence of payment methods is provided to those of you who are enabled for HCO. The default sequence of payment methods displays if you have not set up the payment order, that is, you have both the options, either have the default sequence of payment methods or configure the same.
The spiProducts component is removed from your payment methods sequence and is placed at the bottom. Currently, the spiProducts component is placed at the bottom in the default template. It is not possible to change the order of the list to move this item.
This limitation will impact those of you who opt out of ordering payment methods because the default list has spiProducts component at the bottom as well.
Frequently asked questions
Are there any restrictions on the file size and dimensions for the merchant logo displayed on the payment page?
There are no restrictions on the file size or logo width. The logo height should be at least 144 px.
Can I use any hosting provider for hosting the logo image?
Yes, you can host your logo image on any provider, as long as the URL is secure (HTTPS). If you are looking for a provider that can offer free HTTPS hosting, see secure image hosting providers.Improving Accessibility

The Hosted Payment Page page can provide a user experience compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA accessibility standard. Study the WCAG 2.0 guidelines and ensure that your web site conforms to them.
To ensure that your integration is accessible, set your checkout page language by adding the lang attribute to the <html> element of the page:

<html lang="en">
    <head></head>
    <body></body>
</html>
Customize Redirect and Retry Behavior

If you are using Hosted Checkout, you can customize the redirect and retry behavior as it allows you to limit the retry attempts and redirect the users from the checkout page to the merchant application. The customizations are defined in Initiate Checkout operation.
If you have a checkout integration that uses an embedded form or payment page, you can customize the Mastercard Checkout user experience by redirecting your customers after they encounter a successful or failed payment.
Existing merchants remain unaffected and they can extend the functionality by simply passing the redirectMerchantUrl and retryAttemptCount in Initiate Checkout call while creating the session. The payer redirects to the merchant portal only if both the new variables are passed in Initiate Checkout.
You can customize the redirect and retry behavior for the following options:
Successful transaction
The merchant can always redirect the customers or reside on the checkout disabling redirects.
To redirect, the merchant needs to share the interaction.returnUrl in Initiate Checkout.
Failed transaction
The merchant has three options:
Always redirect customers.
Allow up to three retry attempts before redirecting.
Disable redirects entirely during checkout.
To redirect, the merchant needs to share the interaction.redirectMerchantUrl and interaction.retryAttemptCount in Initiate Checkout.
If the interaction.redirectMerchantUrl and interaction.retryAttemptCount are not passed in Initiate Checkout then, the merchant can choose to limit the retry attempts up to three times without making the payer to redirect to the merchant application by toggling on "Limit session payment attempts.
Frequently asked questions
Which pages the changes are applicable to?
The changes are only applicable to "Modern" Hosted Checkout. The changes are applicable to the Payment page, embedded mode, payment link, and the Initiate Checkout API call.
Which version the changes are available from?
The changes are available from version 63 and later.Integrate Apple Pay in Hosted Checkout

Testing Steps

Careful testing is the cornerstone of software development, ensuring it operates as expected. You cannot move on to a live environment and handle real payments until you have confirmed that your integration works as desired in all scenarios.
Prerequisites
Before you start testing your Hosted Checkout integration, you must complete:
Basic integration using the Hosted Payment Page to gather payment details.
Integration for any subsequent operations you want to handle within your order lifecycles.
Any customizations related to the payment methods you want to support.
All additional features and security-related functionality you need.
Testing your integration
Cover at least the following steps in your testing:
For the payment methods you support, test all individual operations you want to use in your integration where payer interaction is needed on the Hosted Payment Page.
Test the process from creating the checkout session to providing the Hosted Payment Page to the payer and managing the callbacks from the payment page process.
For the payment methods you support, determine the payment flows (combinations of initial and subsequent transactions) you want to be able to use in your integration. Test all the flows with all possible combinations of subsequent transactions.
Test all the additional features and security-related functionality you are using.
Confirm that your system reacts appropriately and overcomes all common error scenarios related to invalid requests and server problems.
For examples of error scenarios to be considered, see Common Transaction Failures.
Determine the transaction responses that require further actions from you, and test that your integration is taking expected actions.
Testing tools
To test your integration, the Mastercard Gateway provides some helpful tools:
Simulators

You can test your requests using various simulators, which you access from your test merchant account. To confirm that you are using your test merchant account, check that the merchant ID supplied by your payment service provider (PSP) has the prefix "TEST". All requests sent with the test merchant ID are regarded test requests and handled by the simulators. They are not sent forward to actual providers, issuers, and acquirers.
If you have already been given a merchant ID that has the "TEST" prefix, that is your test merchant account. Your PSP sends you another merchant ID when you are ready to process live transactions.
The test merchant account is a wholly separate account with a different API password or certificates from your regular account. When switching from one to the other, make sure to change both your merchant ID and any authentication credentials.
For the payment methods that require the payer to provide their approval on the payment provider's web site, the gateway provides an interactive payment simulator. For more information on specific simulator features and options, see the test instructions within specific payment methods and Common Browser Payment Integration.
Test cards

If you support card payments as payment methods, the gateway provides test cards to enable you to test various scenarios, including 3D Secure authentication. For details, see Test Cards and Testing Your Integration for 3DS Authentication.
Predictable response results

The test simulator is configured to generate predictable results based on the transaction request and the card details you supply. For details, see Test Cards and Common Browser Payment Integration.
You can trigger transaction responses that contain a specific Mastercard Gateway Response Code or Card Security Code validation result, as well as Address Verification response code, and ensure that your integration reacts appropriately to each. You can also receive specific response results for features like wallets.
Common transaction failures
When testing your integration, consider the following transaction failure scenarios and make sure your system reacts to them appropriately:
Payment authorization declined or card type not accepted

If the response.gatewayCode in your transaction response has a value starting with DECLINED, the payment authorization has not been approved by the issuing bank or the payer is attempting to use a card type that is not accepted by the gateway.
Study the exact returned gateway code and other details in the transaction to determine in more detail why the payment has been declined. You may need to ask the payer to use a different payment method to solve the problem.
Invalid card information

If the response.gatewayCode in your transaction response is set to INVALID_CSC, EXPIRED_CARD, or similar, the problem is with the payer's card details. The payer has either entered them incorrectly, or the card is no longer valid. You need to ask the payer to check their card details or potentially use a different card.
Insufficient funds

If the response.gatewayCode in your transaction response is set to INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS, the payer's account does not have enough funds to cover the transaction. You need to ask the payer to use a different payment method or card.
Transaction timeout

If the response.gatewayCode in your transaction response is set to TIMED_OUT, the gateway did not receive an answer from the acquirer. Consequently, the transaction was automatically terminated. You need to try again later.

Common transaction failures
Hosted Session

The Hosted Session integration method gives you control over the layout and styling of your payment page, while reducing PCI compliance costs.
The Session JavaScript library enables you to collect sensitive payment details from the payer in hosted payment form fields, sourced from, and controlled by the Mastercard Gateway. Standard browser security protection mechanisms isolate sensitive fields from you, preserving the integrity of the payment channel provided by the gateway. The gateway collects the payment details from the hosted fields in a payment session and temporarily stores them for later use. You can then include a payment session in place of payment details in your payment transaction request to process a payment.
For all initial transactions that require payer participation to provide their payment details, use the payment session to gather the payment details, and then send an API request from your server to initiate the payment transaction. For all merchant-initiated and subsequent transactions that do not require payer participation, send an API request from your server.

Key benefits
The Hosted Session integration method has the following key benefits:
Integration is simple and quick to implement.
No need to collect, store, or process any sensitive payment details, thereby lowering PCI compliance costs.
Maintain control over the styles and layout of your payment page.
Customize the payer experience to suit your business.
Information flow
The payment flow for the Hosted Session integration method is illustrated below:
Hosted Session Integration Method Payment Flow
The following steps describe the Hosted Session payment flow.
The payer initiates the payment process for goods or services in your app or web site.
The payer can choose to provide payments details using a credit or debit card, Click to Pay, gift card, or to make an Automated Clearing House payment. Depending on the chosen payment method, payment details are collected in one of the two ways:
On your payment page: Payment details are collected in form fields embedded in iFrames, also known as inline frames, hosted by the gateway.
Click to Pay: Card details are securely collected from the Click to Pay interaction and sent to the gateway.
The gateway collects the payments details and stores them in a payment session. When you send the payment transaction from your server as an API request, you can include the payment details in the transaction by simply referencing the session. The payment transaction itself is handled similarly to the Direct Payment integration method:
The gateway passes the transaction to your acquiring bank for processing.
The acquirer returns a response to the gateway.
The gateway generates a transaction response and passes it to you. The transaction response indicates if the transaction is successful, and allows you to display a receipt, other confirmation, or an error page to the payer.

Integration Steps

To implement the basic Hosted Session solution in your system, follow the instructions below.
Prerequisites
Before implementing a Hosted Session solution, check with Your payment service provider to ensure you meet the following prerequisites:
Ensure that you have a merchant account and that your merchant profile is enabled for the Hosted Session service.
Ensure that you use API v18 or later.
Select and set up your API authentication method.
Implementing a Hosted Session Integration
The Hosted Session solution works through API operations (requests and responses), which are used to, for example, manage sessions and initiate or retrieve information about various payment transactions. You also need the Session JavaScript library to manage the hosted payment form fields in your app or web page, when payer participation is needed to gather payment details for a transaction. For more information about handling sessions, see Session Basics.
You can use all the API operations available for the REST Server APIs. However, you do not need the Hosted Checkout-related API operations, as they are required for the related integration method.
For more information about making server API requests, see Making a Server API Request.
To perform an operation, you must first have it enabled on your merchant profile by your payment service provider. To check which operations are available for you or to troubleshoot any API errors, contact your payment service provider. The operations available to you are limited to the capability of the acquirers configured on your merchant profile with the Mastercard Gateway. If a functionality is not supported for the acquirer on the gateway, any operation requests to execute that functionality are rejected by the gateway (for that acquirer).
When payer participation is needed, each task you perform with the Hosted Session integration method consists of the following steps:
In your server, create a new session as a container for all the sensitive data required by the transaction.
In your app or web site, attach the hosted form fields to your payment page and allow the payer to fill them in.
In your app or web site, update the session with the provided data.
In your server, send a payment transaction request to the gateway, referring to the session.
In your server, retrieve the response data from the payment transaction. Interpret the response and display the transaction result to the payer in your app or web site.

For information on handling the steps 1-4 above, see Making a Payment. For information about handling the transaction result, see Interpreting the Response.
For a collection of example requests covering the common transaction operation requests, download the Postman collection.
After your integration is completed and you are able to manage basic requests and responses:
Consider your payment lifecycles and needs for any subsequent operations after the basic payment transaction is completed.
Determine any customizations you need to make based on the specific payment methods you want to support.
Consider what kind of security or other additional features you want to offer or use in your integration.
Test your entire solution.

Prerequisites
Implementing a Hosted Session Integration
Payment Sessions

A payment session, or simply session, is a temporary container for request fields containing sensitive data about a specific order. You can use a session to allow the payer to provide their sensitive payment details directly to the Mastercard Gateway. This way you can simply reference the session in any later transaction request, without having to handle the payment details directly. When the Mastercard Gateway receives a transaction request that references a session, it forms the final transaction by combining the fields in the session with those supplied directly in the request.
Using sessions enables more sophisticated integrations where different parts of the request are captured at different points in the payment flow or through different channels. Payment flows for both the Hosted Session and some payment methods, for example, Click to Pay, use sessions to collect and store sensitive payer information. This reduces PCI compliance requirements and implementation costs as you do not handle or store any payment details on your server.
The lifecycle of a single session covers:
Creating the session in your server.
Updating the session in your server with any non-sensitive information you want to store in the session.
Using the session on your web site or app to allow the gateway to gather any sensitive payment details from the payer.
Referencing the session in payment transactions or other operations in your server.

A single session lasts usually about 15 minutes, during which you can send one or more payment transactions, as needed.
Creating a session
You can create a session using the Create Session operation. In the request, you can optionally provide the authentication limit (session.authenticationLimit), which indicates the number of operations which can be submitted to the gateway using the session ID as a password. If the limit is not provided, the gateway sets a default value. You can use the session ID as a password in requests that use session authentication. Session authentication allows you to make API requests directly from your app or web site (instead of your server), and can be used for 3D Secure authentication requests.
The Create Session operation returns the following fields:
session.id - Unique session ID which you must provide on subsequent requests to reference the session.
session.authenticationLimit - Limit you supplied in the request, or the gateway's default value.
session.aes256Key - Key you can use to decrypt sensitive data passed to your web site through the payer's browser or mobile device.
session.version - Session version. You can use this field to implement optimistic locking of the session content.
session.updateStatus - Summary of the outcome of the last attempt to modify the session.
CREATE SESSION request example
URL	https://test-gateway.mastercard.com/api/rest/version/72/merchant/<merchant_ID>/session
HTTP Method	POST

{
    "session": {
      "authenticationLimit": 25
    }
}
   
Updating a session
You can add or update request fields in a session using the Update Session operation. It allows you to add payment and payer data into a session that can subsequently become the input to determine the risk associated with a payer in an authentication operation.
Alternatively, you can update a session using the Update Session From Wallet operation with Click to Pay.
When updating a session, you cannot remove fields from the session, you can only overwrite the values for existing fields.
The Update Session operation can be used in your server to add fields to the session. To add sensitive payment information to a session (by allowing the payer to provide them directly to the gateway), you must use hosted fields on your payment page. For more details on how to handle the hosted fields within the session, see Making a Payment.
UPDATE SESSION request example
URL	https://test-gateway.mastercard.com/api/rest/version/72/merchant/<merchant_ID>/session/<session_ID>
HTTP Method	PUT


{
    "order": {
      "amount": 100,
      "currency": "USD"
    }
}

   
Using a session in a payment transaction
After you have added all the relevant fields to the session (directly from your server or using hosted fields on your payment page), you can refer to that session in any of the following operations by using the session.id field:
Verify
Pay
Authorize
Standalone Capture
Standalone Refund
Create or Update Token
Payment Options Inquiry
Initiate Authentication
Authenticate Payer
It is recommended that you retrieve the session details using the Retrieve Session transaction and check the session contents before you initiate a payment or Tokenization operation.
When you refer to a session in an operation request, if a value for the same field is provided both in the referred session and in the operation request itself, the value in the operation request is used. For more information, see Implementing Multiple Hosted Sessions.
You can perform multiple operations using the same session, for example Pay and Create or Update Token. This is useful if you want to both initiate a payment and store a token to use in future payments.
The API version for operations referencing a session must match the API version used when managing the session itself (such as Create Session and Update Session).
Once you initiate an operation that references a session (except Update Session and Update Session From Wallet), the card security code, if stored in the session, is removed. This is necessary to comply with PCI regulations. If you want to save the card details for later use, you can do this by performing a Create or Update Token operation using the session.
Making business decisions based on session content
If you make business decisions based upon data obtained from a session, you need to use the optimistic locking capability of the session. This ensures that the data you use to make your decisions is the same as that used to process your request operation.
Examples of business decisions based on the session content include:
Calculating the surcharge amount based on the card type provided by the payer.
Calculating the shipping amount based on the shipping address provided by the payer.
To use the optimistic locking capability:
Retrieve the session content using the Retrieve Session operation.
Take note of the session.version value in the response.
Make the business decisions, as needed.
Send your operation request to the gateway and include the session.version value along with the session ID in the request.

If the session content has changed, the session.version in your request does not match the current version and the gateway rejects the operation with error.cause=INVALID_REQUEST.

Making a Payment

This topic describes the steps you need to follow to make a payment using a session where you gather sensitive payment data from the payer with hosted fields on your payment page. This is accomplished using the Session JavaScript library(session.js) in addition to the WSAPI. For a full code snippet example of the entire payment page implementation on a web site, see Payment Page Code Example.
Step 1: Create a session
Create a Session by submitting a Create Session request from your server. Specify a Session authentication limit of 25. The response returns a Session ID that you must use in the subsequent steps to reference this Session.
URL	https://test-gateway.mastercard.com/api/rest/version/72/merchant/<merchant_ID>/session
HTTP Method	POST

{
    "session": {
        "authenticationLimit": 25
    }
}
Step 2: Update the session with the order details
Update the Session with at least the currency and order amount by submitting an Update Session request from your server. The order currency is needed so that you can determine whether the credit card the payer wants to use is supported and whether they need to provide their Card Security Code (CSC).
URL	https://test-gateway.mastercard.com/api/rest/version/72/merchant/<merchant_ID>/session/<session_ID>
HTTP Method	PUT

{
    "order": {
        "amount": 100,
            "currency": "USD"
    }
}
Step 3: Include the session JavaScript library
Include the session.js client JavaScript library hosted by the gateway in your payment page by adding a script element within the head element. The path to this file includes both, the API version and the merchant identifier for the Session. This places a PaymentSession object into the window namespace.

<html>
<head>  
<script src="https://test-gateway.mastercard.com/form/version/72/merchant/<MERCHANTID>/session.js"></script>
</head>
</html>
Step 4: Create the payment page
Create the HTML code for your payment page, including the fields for gathering the necessary payment details from the payer.
To prevent submission of sensitive data to your server, ensure that all sensitive data fields are set as readonly and omit the name attribute.
You can use one or more of the following payment methods to capture payment details from the payer. The fields you need to include on your payment page depend on the payment method:
Credit and Debit cards
You can capture the following card details in hosted fields:
card.number
card.expiryMonth
card.expiryYear
card.securityCode
card.nameOnCard
All the fields are optional; however, if card.expiryMonth is used then card.expiryYear is mandatory and vice versa.
Gift cards
You can capture the following gift card details in hosted fields:
giftCard.number
giftCard.pin
For more information, see Gift Cards.
Automated Clearing House (ACH) Payments
You can capture payment details for Direct Payments (payments) and Direct Deposits (refunds) through Automated Clearing House. You can capture the following Automated Clearing House details in hosted fields:
ach.routingNumber
ach.bankAccountNumber
ach.bankAccountNumberConfirmation
ach.bankAccountHolder
ach.accountType
For more information, see Automated Clearing House.
Click to Pay
You can capture payment details from Click to Pay interaction. For more information, see Click to Pay Hosted Session Integration.
For every supported payment method, the Hosted Session allows you to collect and submit full, partial, or individual (except card expiry month and card expiry year) payment details into a payment Session. You can use the returned payment Session in combination with other payment data sources to process a payment. For example, if you have already tokenized the payer's card number and expiry date, you can use the Hosted Session to collect only the CSC or CVV,and use the card details from both sources collectively to perform a payment. Alternatively, if the card stored against a token has expired, you can use the Hosted Session to collect the new card expiry date in a payment Session and update the token.
The following sample code illustrates the necessary payment page fields for a credit card payment.
Example Request


    <!-- CREATE THE HTML FOR THE PAYMENT PAGE -->
    <div>
      Please enter your payment details:
    </div>
    <div>
      Cardholder Name:
      <input type="text" id="cardholder-name" class="input-field" title="cardholder name"
      aria-label="enter name on card" value="" tabindex="1" readonly>
    </div>
    <div>
      Card Number:
      <input type="text" id="card-number" class="input-field" title="card number"
      aria-label="enter your card number" value="" tabindex="2" readonly>
    </div>
    <div>
      Expiry Month:
      <input type="text" id="expiry-month" class="input-field" title="expiry month"
      aria-label="two digit expiry month" value="" tabindex="3" readonly>
    </div>
    <div>
      Expiry Year:
      <input type="text" id="expiry-year" class="input-field" title="expiry year"
      aria-label="two digit expiry year" value="" tabindex="4" readonly>
    </div>
    <div>
      Security Code:
      <input type="text" id="security-code" class="input-field" title="security code"
      aria-label="three digit CCV security code" value="" tabindex="5" readonly>
    </div>
    <div>
      <button id="payButton" onclick="pay();">
        Pay Now
      </button>
    </div>
Step 5: Configure the session
Invoke the PaymentSession.configure() function with a configuration object as an argument to attach the hosted fields to your payment page and configure the payment interaction. You need to provide the following in the configuration object:
Session ID received when you created the Session.
Field selectors for hosted fields for specific payment methods. The configuration replaces them with corresponding proxy fields embedded in iFrames hosted by the Mastercard Gateway. The proxy fields have the same look and feel as the replaced fields.
Mitigation options for clickjacking prevention. Clickjacking, also known as a "UI redress attack", is when an attacker uses multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the top-level page. To use the Hosted Session, you must implement one or more of the following defenses against clickjacking attacks and specify which defenses are implemented using the frameEmbeddingMitigation field:
Javascript: Include "frame-breaker" JavaScript on your payment page.
x-frame-options: Your server returns an X-Frame Options HTTP response header.
csp: Your server returns a Content-Security-Policy HTTP response header containing a frame-ancestors directive.
For information on defending against clickjacking attacks, see Clickjacking Defense Cheat Sheet on the OWASP external website.
Callbacks for handling various events during the Hosted Session interaction:
initialized() is invoked when the hosted fields attach to your payment page.
formSessionUpdate() is invoked in response to the PaymentSession.updateSessionFromForm(paymentType) function (see next step).
Interaction details that define the visibility and payer interaction options for some displayed information.
Session Configuration Example

<body>
    PaymentSession.configure({
    session: “<your_session_ID>”,
  fields: {
    // ATTACH HOSTED FIELDS TO YOUR PAYMENT PAGE FOR A CREDIT CARD
    card: {
      number: “#card - number”,
      securityCode: “#security - code”,
      expiryMonth: “#expiry - month”,
      expiryYear: “#expiry - year”,
      nameOnCard: “#cardholder - name”
    }
  },
  //SPECIFY YOUR MITIGATION OPTION HERE
  frameEmbeddingMitigation: [“javascript”],
  callbacks: {
    initialized: function(response) {
      // HANDLE INITIALIZATION RESPONSE
    },
    formSessionUpdate: function(response) {
      // HANDLE RESPONSE FOR UPDATE SESSION
    },
  },
  interaction: {
    displayControl: {
      formatCard: “EMBOSSED”,
      invalidFieldCharacters: “REJECT”
    }
  }
});
</body>
Step 6: Update the session with field details
After the payer has entered their payment details in the hosted fields, invoke the PaymentSession.updateSessionFromForm() function with the applicable payment method as an argument. The function stores the captured payment details into the payment Session. Once the operation completes, the formSessionUpdate() callback is invoked with a result parameter. Check the result.status field to determine if the operation was successful. For more information, see Handling Callback Responses.
Session update example

function pay() {
    // UPDATE THE SESSION WITH THE INPUT FROM HOSTED FIELDS
    PaymentSession.updateSessionFromForm('card');
}


              
Step 7: Create payment using the session
Send the payment transaction (or other related operation) from your server to the gateway using the Session ID (session.id) in the request:
Send the Retrieve Session request to verify the details included in the Session.
Create the transaction request by adding any necessary fields not included in the Session.
If you provide in the request a field that is already defined in the Session, the gateway uses the value in the request.
Send the transaction request. For more information about handling API requests, see Making a Server API Request.
You can send multiple operations related to the payment using the same Session. For example, you can both initiate a payment with a PAY operation and store a token representing the payment details (for use in future transactions) with the Create or Update Token operation.

Payment page callbacks
The Hosted Session allows you to use various callbacks to customize how the payment page behaves and what kind of feedback it provides to the payer.
Callbacks for session configuration
This section defines the Session configuration callbacks and the responses returned by their result callbacks. For an example of how to handle the callbacks in your payment page code, see Payment Page Code Example.
The callbacks used in the PaymentSession.configure() function:
initialized(result) callback is invoked when the hosted fields are attached to the payment page:
If result.status=="ok", the hosted fields are successfully attached to your payment page.
Successful Initialization response example

                // An ok response
                {
                  "status": "ok",
                }

              
If result.status=="system_error" or result.status=="request_timeout", an error has occurred while attaching the hosted fields. Retry after a short delay.
Failed Initialization response example

    // An error response (system_error)
    {
      "status": "system_error",
      "message": "System error message."
    }
    // An error response (request_timeout)
    {
      "status": "request_timeout",
      "message": "Request timeout error message."
    }
formSessionUpdate(result) callback is invoked when the hosted field content is stored in the Session:
If result.status=="ok", the Session now contains the collected payment details.
Form Session update example for successful response

    // An ok response
    {
      "status": "ok",
      "merchant": "TESTMERCHANT",
      "session": {
        "id": "SESSION000218450948092491657986""updateStatus": "SUCCESS",
        "version": "e3f144ce02"
      },
      "sourceOfFunds": {
        "provided": {
          "card": {
            "brand": "MASTERCARD",
            "expiry": {
              "month": "1",
              "year": "39"
            },
            "fundingMethod": "DEBIT",
            "nameOnCard": "John Smith",
            "number": "512345xxxxxx8769",
            "scheme": "MASTERCARD"
          }
        },
        "type": "CARD"
      },
      "version": "43"
    }
If result.status=="fields_in_error", the payer input is invalid. Prompt the payer to update their input. The errors response structure contains information about the invalid fields.
Form Session update example for error response

    // An error response (fields_in_error)
    {
      "status": "fields_in_error",
      "session": {
        "id": "SESSION000218450948092491657986"
      },
      "errors": {
        "cardNumber": "invalid",
        "securityCode": "invalid"
      },
      version: "43"
    }
If result.status=="system_error" or result.status=="request_timeout", an error has occurred when processing the update. Retry the Session update after a short delay.
Form Session update example for system error and timeout response

// An error response (system_error)
{
    "status": "system_error",
    "session": {
        "id": "SESSION000218450948092491657986"
    },
    "errors": {
        "message": "System error message."
    },
    "version": "43"
}
  // An error response (request_timeout)
{
    "status": "request_timeout",
    "session": {
        "id": "SESSION000218450948092491657986"
    },
    "errors": {
        "message": "Request timeout error message."
    },
    "version": "43"
}

              
Callbacks for hosted fields
The Hosted Session allows you to register callback functions to handle events that can occur on the hosted fields during the payer's interaction. The events allow you to track what the payer is doing and provide validation feedback to them during various payment interaction stages.
You can register callback functions for the following events:
onChange(): Invoked when the input value in the hosted field in the iFrame has changed.
onFocus(): Invoked when the hosted field in the iFrame has gained focus.
onBlur(): Invoked when the hosted field in the iFrame has lost focus. Once the payer has finished typing and leaves the field, and this event is triggered, invoke the validate() function and display any errors for the field from the validate() function’s callback.
onMouseOver(): Invoked when a mouse over event occurs in the hosted field.
onMouseOut(): Invoked when a mouse out event occurs in the hosted field.
onValidityChange(): Invoked after the payer’s each keystroke, providing feedback on the validity of the payer’s data entry so far.
Regardless of how you handle the hosted field events above, you must expect and handle errors from the formSessionUpdate() session configuration callback. While the validate() function can indicate validity, the formSessionUpdate() validation is more comprehensive and can detect additional errors.
Form Session update example for system error and timeout response

/**
 * Provide an array of field roles for proxy fields as the first parameter
* Each callback function is invoked with the selector for the field whose proxy triggered the event.
 */

PaymentSession.onBlur( ["card.number", "card.nameOnCard", "card.securityCode", "card.expiryYear", "card.expiryMonth"],

function(selector, role)

{
  PaymentSession.validate('card',
  function(allresult) {

    if (allresult.card[role].isValid) {

      console.log("The field is valid");
      document.querySelector(selector).style.borderColor = "green";

    } else {

      console.log("The field is invalid");

      document.querySelector(selector).style.borderColor = "red";

    }
  });
  PaymentSession.onFocus(['card.number', 'card.securityCode'],
  function(selector) {
    //handle focus event
  });
  PaymentSession.onChange(['card.securityCode'],
  function(selector) {
    //handle change event
  });
  PaymentSession.onMouseOver(['card.number'],
  function(selector) {
    //handle mouse over event
  });
  PaymentSession.onMouseOut(['card.number'],
  function(selector) {
    //handle mouse out event
  });

  PaymentSession.onValidityChange(["card.number", "card.nameOnCard"],
  function(selector, result) {

    if (result.isValid) {

      console.log("The field value is valid");

      document.querySelector(selector).style.borderColor = "green";

    } else if (result.isIncomplete) {
      console.log("The field value is not yet valid");
      document.querySelector(selector).style.borderColor = "grey";
    } else {

      console.log("The field value is invalid");

      document.querySelector(selector).style.borderColor = "red";

    }
  });
Frequently asked questions
How do I handle the event where a card type entered by the payer is not supported on my merchant profile?
To handle this event, first use the PAYMENT OPTIONS INQUIRY operation to get a list of supported card types. Then inspect the card type information (sourceOfFunds.provided.card.brand and sourceOfFunds.provided.card.scheme) in the PaymentSession.updateSessionFromForm('card') response, validate it against the list of supported card types, and display an error message if the card type is not accepted.
How do I know whether the payer's CSC or CVV is needed and has been provided?
To find out whether CSC or CVV is required, use the PAYMENT OPTIONS INQUIRY operation. If the payer does not provide CSC/CVV, the securityCode field is NOT returned in the PaymentSession.updateSessionFromForm('card') response. If you require a CSC/CVV and no value is present, you need to display an error to the payer.
Do event callbacks for hosted fields work on all browsers?
There are known issues with event callbacks on the following operating systems and browsers:
Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 10: If interaction.displayControl.formatCard=EMBOSSED, the onChange() event is not triggered when you change the value of a hosted field.
iOS9 on iPhone 6+: The onChange() and onBlur() events are not triggered when the payer enters data in a hosted field and touches another field in the payment page. Further, the payer cannot navigate from hosted fields to other fields on the payment page and vice versa.
Hover events are not supported on touchscreen devices.

Test Cards

When testing your Mastercard Gateway integration for card payments, you can trigger specific responses and results for your transaction operations using various test cards. When accessing a card emulator, use your test merchant profile with the "TEST" prefix that your payment service provider supplies.
Card transaction test details
Following are the different card transaction test details.
Standard test cards – all supported regions
Use the following standard test cards unless specific cards for your acquirer and region are provided in the other sections.
You can use different expiry dates, CSC/CVV values, and the billing address street names in the request to generate different responses.
UATP cards do not support CSC/CVV and 3DS.
Please note that "3-D Secure Enrolled" means 3DS is supported for testing these cards with authentication.channel=PAYER_BROWSER in the INITIATE_AUTHENTICATION API, but not with other channels.
To test the 3D Secure authentication functionality in more detail and using the 3DS emulator, see testing your 3DS integration.

NPCI BEPG Mastercard Gateway internal simulator
To access the Mastercard Gateway test simulator, enter "TEST" as a prefix to the Merchant ID supplied by your payment service provider. If the Merchant ID supplied already has "TEST" as the first four letters, you are already using the test simulator, and your payment service provider sends you another Merchant ID when you are ready to process live transactions.
The test simulator is configured to generate predictable results based on the transaction request and card details you supply.

Payment options inquiry test cards – Dynamic Currency Conversion
If you are enabled for Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC), you can use different currency pairs in the PAYMENT OPTIONS INQUIRY request to trigger a response with a specific exchange rate for a specific payer currency.
In requests that use a test merchant profile, the Mastercard Payment Gateway modifies the exchange rate by retaining the first 2 relevant, non-zero values (3.2 in case of MYR) and appending 9s to fill up to 6 significant values. This is to indicate that the returned exchange rate is for test purposes only.
DCC Examples
Successful Rate Quote Request
Provide a request for a test merchant profile with:
Card number: 5313359999999089 (currency of card is MYR)
Order amount: 20 USD
The returned response has:
Payer currency: MYR
Payer exchange rate: 3.29999
Payer amount: 20 * 3.29999 = 65.9998 MYR
Currency conversion gateway response code: QUOTE_PROVIDED
Failed Rate Quote Request
Provide a request for a test merchant profile with:
Card number with a prefix for a valid DCC card type (Visa, Mastercard, or Maestro) that is not in the list of the DCC test cards (refer to the tables below).
Order amount of 20 KWD, where KWD is a currency which is not in the list of DCC test currencies (refer to the tables below).
The returned response has the currency conversion gateway response code: NOT_ELIGIBLE
You can continue testing AUTHORIZE/CAPTURE/PAY transactions using the DCC card numbers and the DCC information returned in the PAYMENT OPTIONS INQUIRY response. However, you cannot perform the Mod 10 (Luhn algorithm) check with the DCC test card numbers (as the rate quotes only consider the first 10 digits of the card number).

The following test card numbers and corresponding currencies can be used in all regions.
Base Currency = USD (US Dollar)
